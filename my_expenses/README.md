## 🛠 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Flutter SDK**: Version 3.10.7 or higher ([Download Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install))
- **Dart SDK**: Included with Flutter
- **Git**: For version control
- **Android Studio** (for Android development) or **Xcode** (for iOS development)
- **Supabase Account**: Free account at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
- **Environment Variables**: `.env` file with Supabase credentials

### Verify Installation

```bash
flutter --version
dart --version
```

---

## 📦 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my_expenses.git
cd my_expenses
```

### 2. Install Flutter Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

This command reads the `pubspec.yaml` file and downloads all required packages:
- **supabase_flutter**: Backend database and authentication
- **intl**: Internationalization and date formatting
- **fl_chart**: Beautiful chart visualizations
- **file_saver**: Export transaction records
- **flutter_dotenv**: Environment variable management
- **path_provider**: File system access
- **share_plus**: Share functionality across platforms

### 3. Setup Supabase Backend

1. Create a free account at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create a new project
3. In your Supabase dashboard:
   - Navigate to **Settings** → **API**
   - Copy your **Project URL** and **Anon Key**

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory:

```bash
# .env
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
```

**Example:**
```
SUPABASE_URL=https://example.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

> ⚠️ **Important**: Never commit the `.env` file to version control. Add it to `.gitignore`.

### 5. Generate Launcher Icons (Optional)

If you've updated the app icon:

```bash
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons
```

This generates native icons for iOS, Android, and other platforms from `assets/icon/icon2.png`.

# Run on default device
flutter run

# Run on specific device
